# Mobile Code Verification Fix

This update resolves issues with code verification not working properly across different devices (laptop vs. mobile).

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Case Handling**: Codes are now standardized (uppercase, trimmed) consistently across all devices.
2. **Improved localStorage Management**: Direct use of proxyService for all code operations.
3. **More Robust Comparison**: Code verification now uses strict standardization on both sides.
4. **Better Error Messages**: More helpful suggestions when codes are mistyped.
5. **Expanded Debugging**: Additional logging to help diagnose issues.

## How to Test the Fix

1. **Deploy the Updated App**: Deploy these changes to your hosting service (Netlify).

2. **Generate Codes on Laptop**:
   - Log in to the admin portal (username: admin, password: admin123)
   - Generate several codes (both single and batch)
   - Note down a few codes for testing

3. **Verify Codes Work on Laptop**:
   - Go to the public portal
   - Enter one of the generated codes
   - Verify it works and redirects to the game

4. **Verify Codes Work on Mobile**:
   - Open the public portal on your mobile device
   - Enter one of the remaining codes (exactly as generated)
   - Verify it works and redirects to the game

5. **Test Case Sensitivity**:
   - Try entering a code in lowercase on either device
   - Verify it still works despite the case difference

6. **Test Used Codes**:
   - Try re-using a code that's already been used
   - Verify you get the "already used" message

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache on the problematic device.

2. **Check Console Logs**: Open browser developer tools to view console logs for detailed error information.

3. **Verify localStorage**: 
   - Open developer tools
   - Navigate to Application tab (Chrome) or Storage tab (Firefox)
   - Check the contents of localStorage for `mockDb_codes`
   - Verify codes are properly formatted

4. **Restart Application**: Sometimes reloading the application completely helps.

## Technical Details

The fix focuses on solving CORS and API-related issues by:

1. Making the application work completely offline using localStorage
2. Enforcing standardized code format across all platforms
3. Using more robust code comparison methods
4. Adding additional error handling and failsafes
